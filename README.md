# Bravo Backend

Healthy office cultures often acknowledge good work from their coworkers and peers. Award your peers with acknowledgements that act like coins/points in Slack when they do awesome things - and never let the acknowledgement of their good work get lost in the shuffle again.

## Bot Commands
Type `/bravo @user` to choose between sending and viewing all acknowledgements
